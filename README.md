================

This project contains an implementation of a Struts2 plugin providing
dependency injection in a way that is similar to what Sprint and Google 
Guice do, with almost no dependency. You can inject JavaEE resources (EJBs,
Datasources, JMS queues and topics, connection factories), POJOs, values
(strings, integeres, random values) by annotating the relevant field and
providing binding information.
